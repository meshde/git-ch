I use a very unpopular editor that generates secret files for it's internal working
I don't want these files to appear in my git-status and I most definitely don't want to commit these files
I know I can add these to the repository's .gitignore file
but my colleagues strongly suggest not polluting the project's .gitignore due to my local environment.
What should I do?
