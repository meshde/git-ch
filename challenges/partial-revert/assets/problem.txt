My last commit made a few changes to a very complicated set of functions and everything was working fine.
But the business requirement has changed now and apparently we only want some
of the changes made in the last commit and want to discard the rest.
My teammates expect me to do so without modifying the existing commit history
(in case the requirements change again and we want to go back).
Now the codebase is highly complex without any sort of test cases written and I
am shit scared to make the changes manually. Due to the urgency of the matter I
will not be able to manually test every possible case.

I definitely want to add a new commit that just partially reverts the last commit.

NOTE: The changes that need to be reverted/kept have been marked so in the
comments in file.py. Please revert the changes that include the comment
"Changes to be reverted".
